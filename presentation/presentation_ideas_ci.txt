Problem:
Authorities have a slow response when a Dengue outbreak occurs because of the bureaucracy and time to centralize results. Because of that, the allocation of resources dedicated to fighting Dengue is sub-optimal and not well-timed.

—————————

Solution:
Real time monitoring and detection of Dengue reports on social media channels

—————————

How we solve it:
  We choose a region to monitor. We decided on Latin America because:
  - language uniformity (only 2 large languages spoken: Spanish and Portugese)
  - relative large Internet penetration (South America) : 66.7% compared to 50.1% world average (www.internetworldstats.com/stats15.htm) -> attach picture; add Central America and Carribeans

—————————

Data : 
- tweets that contain the word ‘Dengue’; source: Twitter.com

To be added:
- google searches for ‘Dengue’; source: Google.com
- facebook statuses that contain ‘Dengue’; source: Facebook.com

We collect only the data that has a location attached (only about 10% of the tweets contain location data).

We further filter the tweets and keep only tweets related to personal experience (PET).
To identify the PET based on Text analisys -> more details to be inserted here 
we used a machine learning classification algorithm (Random Forest) to determine which tweets are PET 
Reason:
Personal Experience tweets are more relevant to potential Dengue cases than tweets posted by organizations, public institutions or companies.

Finally we get a set of tweets which are:
-contain ‘Dengue’
-geo-localized
-personal experience tweets

Tweet examples:
2016-11-15 00:14:22 - Belo Horizonte, Brazil - “To com dengue pela segunda vez do ano só pq arrumei emprego Odeio minha vida” - “I'm dengue for the second time of the year just because I got a job I hate my life“
2016-11-08 20:59:32 - Balneário Camboriú, Brasil - “Pelo menos essa dengue me fez emagrecer mais uns quilinhos Haha” - “At least this dengue made me lose a few more pounds Haha”
2016-11-11 18:52:38 - Tampico, Tamaulipas - “Malditos moscos. Me dio dengue” - “Damn flies. I got dengue“

With these curated tweets we build potential Dengue hotspots using a machine learning clustering algorithm called D-Stream.

The output of this algorithm is a list of location based clusters that decay over time.
-> insert visualization

Confirming that the clusters are correlated with confirmed Dengue cases:
We downloaded confirmed Dengue cases per region per week from the Health Ministry of Brazil for the first 3 weeks of January 2016.
We projected the tweets on the same map with the Dengue cases.

The correlation between the tweets and the confirmed Dengue cases is -> insert number here.

Based on the conclusions above, we can conclude that the presence of clusters based on tweets are a good indicator of the real Dengue cases.
