 There is a folder for each member, named with their initials.
 Each member should add their code to the respective folder.
 We choose this solution mainly because each one of us will be exploring different solutions.
 In addition to that, we don't have to waste time fixing merge conflicts.
 If a member wants to use or change code written by another member, they can copy the code in their folder.
